            <p style=" font-size: 1.3rem;">
                Like Johnny Depp, I love Heath Ledger due to mainly one role, this one being him as the Joker from <i>The Dark Knight</i>. His portrayal of the famous comic villain as well as his dedicatiopn to the character went down in history. Unfortunately, his method acting may have took more of a toll than anyone could have imagined. Other popular movies he played in include <i>The Patrioit</i>, <i>10 Things I Hate about You</i>, and <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>. I believe if he was still with us, Ledger would have gone to become one of the best actors today.

                heath Ledger was born on April 4, 1979 in Perth, Western Australia. He took drama in high school and packed up with a friend sixty-nine cents to Sydney. Ledger struggled to gain traction in his career until a lead role in <i>Two Hands</i> (1999). During the editing of <i>The Dark Knight</i>, he was found dead in his apartment on January 22, 2008. Ledger took method acting to the extreme, locking himself away for weeks to get the dereanged psyche of the Joker, he even encouraged Christian Bale(Batman) to actually hit him during the interrogation scene. Ledger trained his voice and woked with the makeup and costume departments for his characters look. Even his mannerisms of the character were original, one being his licking lips tick which came from the fake scars on his face. Since they would keep falling off when he talked, he would lick them to kepp them in place. Heath lEdger received more than 30 posthumous accolades for his performance as the Joker including Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and Best Actor International Award.
