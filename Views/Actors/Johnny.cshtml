            <p style=" font-size: 1.3rem;">
                While I mostly know him for his role as the (great) Captain Jack Sparrow from the <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> series, I know the actor is known to be far greater. There a re a few movies on my radar that I want to watch with him starring, but Jack Sparrow is one of my all-time favorite movie characters. His dedication to the role and portrayal just ooze originality and memorable moments.

                Johnny Depp was born in Owensboro, Kentucky on June 9, 1963. Johnny was raised in Florida and dropped out of school when he was 15 to be a part of music-garage bands (one named 'The Kids'). Later in his life a visit to California with his wife (Lori A. Depp at the time), he met with Nicholas Cage who advised him to turn to acting, which led him to his first debut film <i>A Nightmare on Elm Street</i> (1984). His career exploded when he replaced Jeff Yagher in the role of an undercover cop Tommy Hanson in  the 1987 hit TV series <i>21 Jump Street</i>. Depp continued to play roles that suprised people with his as a "serious, somewhat dark, idiosyncratic performer". His role as Jack Sparrow opened many doors for him and provided him with an Oscar nomination.
