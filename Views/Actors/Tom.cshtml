            <p style=" font-size: 1.3rem;">
                Tom hardy is a dedicated actor. He applies himself to his roles and I especially like the roles he plays. Some of my favorite movies star him such as <i>The Dark Knight Rises</i>, <i>Lawless</i>, or <i>Warrior</i>. He plays serious and funny roles, such as his buddy-cop interactions with the symbiote Venom in one of his latest movies. He also was of English and Irish decent, which provides more flexability with his accent.
